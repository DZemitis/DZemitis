:wave: Hi There!

My name is Davis and I'm from Riga, Latvia. I'm a pretty open person and I have been caught up in coding. For now, I have been working mainly with C# but I love to learn new things like other languages, some stuff like Unity, and even some Blender! Currently, I'm learning more about WEB API (ASP.NET) but in near future, I will make some progress with Angular. Afar from programing I love to travel, to see new cultures and learn some new stuff

- ðŸŒ± My skillset for now: C# .Net, Unit testing, SQL, GIT. Have a basic knowledge about css, html, Javasacript/Typescritp and Unity.
